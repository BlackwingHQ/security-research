# Security Policy
This project hosts security advisories and their accompanying proof-of-concepts related to research conducted at Blackwing.

## Disclosure Policy

The Blackwing Intelligence research team is dedicated to protecting users.

We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. 

This is why Blackwing adheres to a 90-day disclosure deadline.

When we identify a vulnerability in a project or product, we will report it by contacting the publicly-listed security contact for the project or vendor if one exists; otherwise we will attempt to contact the stakeholders directly.

If the responsible team responds and agrees the issue poses a security risk, we will work with the security team or maintainers to communicate the vulnerability in detail, and agree on the process for public disclosure. Responsibility for developing and releasing a patch lies firmly with the project team, though we aim to facilitate this by providing detailed information about the vulnerability.

We work with vendors, open source maintainers, and other third parties (stakeholders) that are responsible for addressing security vulnerabilities in their products or projects. After notifying stakeholders of vulnerabilities, details will be shared in public with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the stakeholder releases a fix. That deadline can vary in the following ways:

- If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend or US public holiday, the deadline will be moved to the next normal work day.
- Before the 90-day deadline has expired, if a vendor lets us know that a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day that will fall within 14 days following the deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.
- When we observe a previously unknown and unpatched vulnerability in software under active exploitation (a “0day”), we believe that more urgent action—within 7 days—is appropriate. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more devices or accounts will be compromised. Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information. As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available so that users can take steps to protect themselves. We believe it’s important that vendors disclose that there is evidence to suggest that the vulnerability is under active exploitation.

As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme circumstances. We remain committed to treating all vendors strictly equally. Blackwing expects to be held to the same standard.

This policy is strongly in line with our desire to improve industry response times to security bugs, but also results in softer landings for bugs marginally over deadline. We call on all researchers to adopt disclosure deadlines in some form, and feel free to use our policy verbatim if you find our record and reasoning compelling. Creating pressure towards more reasonably-timed fixes will result in smaller windows of opportunity for blackhats to abuse vulnerabilities. In our opinion, vulnerability disclosure policies such as ours result in greater overall safety for users of the Internet.
